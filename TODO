./bootstrap:

Only certain versions of libtoolize require adding file content to aclocal.m4.
v 2.2.2 requires it (tested on cygwin).  v. 1.5.24 does not (tested on
linux), and v. 1.5.27a does not (tested on cygwin).

Need to figure out a) if the "cat >> aclocal.m4" can be avoided altogether; and
b) if not, exactly which versions of libtoolize need it.
