./bootstrap:

  Only certain versions of libtoolize require adding file content to aclocal.m4.
  v 2.2.2 requires it (tested on cygwin).  v. 1.5.24 does not (tested on
  linux), and v. 1.5.27a does not (tested on cygwin).

  Need to figure out a) if the "cat >> aclocal.m4" can be avoided altogether;
  and b) if not, exactly which versions of libtoolize need it.


* "make dist" is broken when run from directories containing spaces in the
  path.


* src/calcfield

  tests are disabled because they are failing.


* These utilities need tests:

  src/add_field/
  src/buffer/
  src/csvformat/
  src/dates_in_range/
  src/dbstream/
  src/deltadays/
  src/fieldsplit/
  src/findfiles/
  src/range/
  src/tochar/
  src/translate_field/
