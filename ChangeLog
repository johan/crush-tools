Changes in the "2008-10" release (2008-07-15 thru 2008-10-04):

* Make sure m4 is available at configure-time.  Previously it was assumed that
  the install host had m4 installed, but then the Perl scripts would fail to
  build.

* Check for presence of non-standard Perl modules, and only build scripts with
  those dependencies if the modules are installed.

* Allow escape sequences to be specified as delimiter arguments in utilities
  written in Perl.

* Add a "contrib" directory for non-core utilities, etc.

* Add options to mergekeys to allow user-specified key fields as an alternative
  to auto-detection of keys.  This currently does NOT remove the requirement
  that both files have a header line.

* Prepend all error messages with the name of the executable.

* Improve testing, and include test files in the distribution package.

* Bug-fix in find_not_processed - printed file names were not space-separated
  when -p option was specified.

* Avoid Perl warnings in csvformat when there is no linebreak at EOF, and fix
  commandline option specifications to avoid ambiguity.

* Make cutfield correctly handle empty fields.  It previously failed to output
  fields which were empty in the input.

* Fix a bug in reorder which causes a seg-fault when large ranges are 
  specified in the -f option.

* Bug fix in aggregate2 - print the header correctly line when the last field
  is one of the keys.  This bug was introducing a line break in the header line.

* Bug fix in aggregate2 - handle empty key fields correctly.

* Standardize and centralize the version reported by the applications.

* Add --Header option to dbstream to print the sql header fields if specified.
