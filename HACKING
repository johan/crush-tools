-- Compilation --

To build CRUSH from a repository checkout...

1) install cgener (http://code.google.com/p/cgener/) at /usr/local/bin
2) ./bootstrap
3) ./configure && make
4) "make install" if desired.

To build from a distribution tarball, only steps 3 and 4 are necessary.


-- Coding Standards --

CRUSH uses the portion of the Google C++ coding standards which applies to C.
(ref: http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml)

C files can automatically get *most* of this formatting by issuing the following
command:

  indent -br -brf -brs -cdw -ce -cli2 -i2 -l80 -lp -npcs -nprs -npsl -nut \
         -saf -sai -saw -ts2 <filename.c>

If you use this, it should only be done on new source files.  When modifying
existing files, maintain consistency with the surrounding code.

Log messages in follow the convention used by the Subversion project.  See

-- Release Schedule --

In order to avoid the tempation to cut a release after each feature or bug fix
is added to a single application, CRUSH will be released on a strictly
time-based schedule.  A release will be created every 3 months.  Whatever
features or fixes have been completed at that time will be included in the
new release.
