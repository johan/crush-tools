-- Compilation --

To build CRUSH from a repository checkout...

1) install cgener (http://code.google.com/p/cgener/) at /usr/local/bin
2) ./bootstrap
3) ./configure && make
4) "make install" if desired.

To build from a distribution tarball, only steps 3 and 4 are necessary.


-- Contributer License Agreement --

Contributers must sign a CLA which defines the terms by which Google (the
copyright holder of CRUSH) can use the contributions.  If you would like to
submit patches, please read and sign

  http://code.google.com/legal/individual-cla-v1.0.html

This just documents that the project has the right to include the code you
send us.


-- Coding Standards --

CRUSH uses the portion of the Google C++ coding standards which applies to C.
(ref: http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml)

C files can automatically get *most* of this formatting by issuing the following
command:

  indent -br -brf -brs -cdw -ce -cli2 -i2 -l80 -lp -npcs -nprs -npsl -nut \
         -saf -sai -saw -ts2 <filename.c>

If you use this, it should only be done on new source files.  When modifying
existing files, maintain consistency with the surrounding code.


-- Source Repository --

Log messages in follow the convention used by the Subversion project.  See

-- Release Schedule --

In order to avoid the tempation to cut a release after each feature or bug fix
is added to a single application, CRUSH will be released on a strictly
time-based schedule.  A release will be created every 3 months.  Whatever
features or fixes have been completed at that time will be included in the
new release.
